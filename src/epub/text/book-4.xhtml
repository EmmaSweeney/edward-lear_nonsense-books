					<h4>THE DONG WITH A LUMINOUS NOSE.</h4>
					<p>
						<span>When awful darkness and silence reign</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the great Gromboolian plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Through the long, long wintry nights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the angry breakers roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As they beat on the rocky shore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore,—</span>
					</p>
					<p>Then, through the vast and gloomy dark<br/> There moves what seems a fiery spark,—<br/> <span class="i2">A lonely spark with silvery rays</span> <span class="i4">Piercing the coal-black night,—</span> <span class="i4">A Meteor strange and bright:</span> <span class="i2">Hither and thither the vision strays,</span> <span class="i4">A single lurid light.</span> </p>
					<p>Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps,—<br/> Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;<br/> And ever as onward it gleaming goes<br/> A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.<br/> And those who watch at that midnight hour<br/> From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br/> Cry, as the wild light passes along,—<br/> <span class="i4">"The Dong! the Dong!</span> <span class="i2">The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</span> <span class="i4">The Dong! the Dong!</span> <span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!"</span> </p>
					<p><span class="i4">Long years ago</span> <span class="i2">The Dong was happy and gay,</span> Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl<br/> <span class="i2">Who came to those shores one day.</span> For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did,—<br/> Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd<br/> <span class="i4">Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</span> <span class="i2">And the rocks are smooth and gray.</span> And all the woods and the valleys rang<br/> With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang,—<br/> <i><span class="i6">"Far and few, far and few,</span> <span class="i6">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span> <span class="i6">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span> <span class="i6">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i> </p>
					<p>Happily, happily passed those days!<br/> <span class="i8">While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</span> <span class="i4">They danced in circlets all night long,</span> <span class="i4">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</span> <span class="i8">In moonlight, shine, or shade.</span> For day and night he was always there<br/> By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,<br/> With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;<br/> Till the morning came of that hateful day<br/> When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,<br/> And the Dong was left on the cruel shore<br/> Gazing, gazing for evermore,—<br/> Ever keeping his weary eyes on<br/> That pea-green sail on the far horizon,—<br/> Singing the Jumbly Chorus still<br/> As he sate all day on the grassy hill,—<br/> <i><span class="i10">"Far and few, far and few,</span> <span class="i10">Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</span> <span class="i10">Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</span> <span class="i10">And they went to sea in a sieve."</span></i> </p>
					<p>But when the sun was low in the West,<br/> <span class="i4">The Dong arose and said,—</span> —"What little sense I once possessed<br/> <span class="i4">Has quite gone out of my head!"</span> And since that day he wanders still<br/> By lake and forest, marsh and hill,<br/> Singing, "O somewhere, in valley or plain,<br/> Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!<br/> For ever I'll seek by lake and shore<br/> Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!"</p>
					<p><span class="i2">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</span> <span class="i2">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;</span> <span class="i2">And because by night he could not see,</span> <span class="i2">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</span> <span class="i4">On the flowery plain that grows.</span> <span class="i4">And he wove him a wondrous Nose,—</span> <span class="i2">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</span> Of vast proportions and painted red,<br/> And tied with cords to the back of his head.<br/> <span class="i2">—In a hollow rounded space it ended</span> <span class="i2">With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</span> <span class="i4">All fenced about</span> <span class="i4">With a bandage stout</span> <span class="i4">To prevent the wind from blowing it out;</span> <span class="i2">And with holes all round to send the light</span> <span class="i2">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</span> </p>
					<p>And now each night, and all night long,<br/> Over those plains still roams the Dong;<br/> And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe<br/> You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,<br/> While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,<br/> To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;<br/> Lonely and wild, all night he goes,—<br/> The Dong with a luminous Nose!<br/> And all who watch at the midnight hour,<br/> From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,<br/> Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,<br/> Moving along through the dreary night,—<br/> <span class="i2">"This is the hour when forth he goes,</span> <span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span> <span class="i2">Yonder, over the plain he goes,—</span> <span class="i4">He goes!</span> <span class="i4">He goes,—</span> <span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!"</span> </p>

					<h4>THE TWO OLD BACHELORS.</h4>
					<p><span>Two old Bachelors were living in one house;</span><br/>
					<span>One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.</span><br/> Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse,—<br/> "This happens just in time! For we've nothing in the house,<br/> Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,<br/> And what to do for dinner—since we haven't any money?<br/> And what can we expect if we haven't any dinner,<br/> But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?"</p>
					<p>Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin,—<br/> "We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin'!<br/> If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;<br/> But how to get that Stuffin' it is difficult to tell!"</p>
					<p>Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town<br/> And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;<br/> They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found<br/> In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.</p>
					<p>But some one said, "A hill there is, a little to the north,<br/> And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;<br/> And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage,—<br/> An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.<br/> Climb up, and seize him by the toes,—all studious as he sits,—<br/> And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!<br/> Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps),—<br/> When your Stuffin' will be ready, and very good—perhaps."</p>
					<p>Those two old Bachelors without loss of time<br/> The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;<br/> And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,<br/> They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.</p>
					<p>"You earnest Sage!" aloud they cried, "your book you've read enough in!<br/> We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin'!"</p>
					<p>But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,<br/> At those two Bachelors' bald heads a certain aim he took;<br/> And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down,—<br/> At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;<br/> And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin'),<br/> The Mouse had fled—and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.</p>
					<p>They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;<br/> And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.</p>

					<h4>THE PELICAN CHORUS</h4>
					<p><span>King and Queen of the Pelicans we;</span><br/> No other Birds so grand we see!<br/> None but we have feet like fins!<br/> With lovely leathery throats and chins!<br/> <span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span> <span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span> <span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican Jill!</span> <span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still</span> </p>
					<p>We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.<br/> By night we sleep on the cliffs above;<br/> By day we fish, and at eve we stand<br/> On long bare islands of yellow sand.<br/> And when the sun sinks slowly down,<br/> And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,<br/> Where the purple river rolls fast and dim<br/> And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,<br/> Wing to wing we dance around,<br/> Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,<br/> Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;<br/> And this is the song we nightly snort,—<br/> <span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span> <span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span> <span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span> <span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span> </p>
					<p>Last year came out our Daughter Dell,<br/> And all the Birds received her well.<br/> To do her honor a feast we made<br/> For every bird that can swim or wade,—<br/> Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,<br/> Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,<br/> Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,<br/> Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:<br/> Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!<br/> They ate and drank and danced all night,<br/> And echoing back from the rocks you heard<br/> Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird,—<br/> <span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span> <span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span> <span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span> <span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span> </p>
					<p>Yes, they came; and among the rest<br/> The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.<br/> Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float<br/> Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;<br/> With pea-green trowsers all so neat,<br/> And a delicate frill to hide his feet<br/> (For though no one speaks of it, every one knows<br/> He has got no webs between his toes).<br/> </p>
					<p>As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,<br/> In violent love that Crane King fell,—<br/> On seeing her waddling form so fair,<br/> With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.<br/> And before the end of the next long day<br/> Our Dell had given her heart away;<br/> For the King of the Cranes had won that heart<br/> With a Crocodile's egg and a large fish-tart.<br/> She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,<br/> Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;<br/> And away they flew in a gathering crowd<br/> Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.<br/> <span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span> <span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span> <span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span> <span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span> </p>
					<p>And far away in the twilight sky<br/> We heard them singing a lessening cry,—<br/> Farther and farther, till out of sight,<br/> And we stood alone in the silent night!<br/> Often since, in the nights of June,<br/> We sit on the sand and watch the moon,—<br/> She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,<br/> And we probably never shall meet again!<br/> Oft, in the long still nights of June,<br/> We sit on the rocks and watch the moon,—<br/> She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.<br/> And we probably never shall see her more.<br/> <span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span> <span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span> <span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span> <span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span> </p>

					<h4>THE POBBLE WHO HAS NO TOES</h4>
					<p class="versenumber">I.</p>
					<p><span class="largecap">T</span>he Pobble who has no toes<br/>
					<span class="i2">Had once as many as we;</span> When they said, "Some day you may lose them all;"<br/> <span class="i2">He replied, "Fish fiddle de-dee!"</span> And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink<br/> Lavender water tinged with pink;<br/> For she said, "The World in general knows<br/> There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"</p>
					<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
					<p><span class="largecap">T</span>he Pobble who has no toes,<br/>
					<span class="i2">Swam across the Bristol Channel;</span> But before he set out he wrapped his nose<br/> <span class="i2">In a piece of scarlet flannel.</span> <a class="pagenumber" id="page361" name="page361" title="361"/> For his Aunt Jobiska said, "No harm<br/> Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;<br/> And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes<br/> Are safe—provided he minds his nose."</p>
					<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
					<p>The Pobble swam fast and well,<br/> <span class="i2">And when boats or ships came near him,</span> He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled a bell<br/> <span class="i2">So that all the world could hear him.</span> And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,<br/> When they saw him nearing the further side,—<br/> "He has gone to fish, for his Aunt Jobiska's<br/> Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"</p>
					<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
					<p>But before he touched the shore,—<br/> <span class="i2">The shore of the Bristol Channel,</span> A sea-green Porpoise carried away<br/> <span class="i2">His wrapper of scarlet flannel.</span> And when he came to observe his feet,<br/> Formerly garnished with toes so neat,<br/> His face at once became forlorn<br/> On perceiving that all his toes were gone!</p>
					<p class="versenumber">V.</p>
					<p>And nobody ever knew,<br/> <span class="i2">From that dark day to the present,</span> Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,<br/> <span class="i2">In a manner so far from pleasant.</span> <a class="pagenumber" id="page362" name="page362" title="362"/> Whether the shrimps or crawfish gray,<br/> Or crafty Mermaids stole them away,<br/> Nobody knew; and nobody knows<br/> How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!</p>
					<p class="versenumber">VI.</p>
					<p>The Pobble who has no toes<br/> <span class="i2">Was placed in a friendly Bark,</span> And they rowed him back, and carried him up<br/> <span class="i2">To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.</span> And she made him a feast, at his earnest wish,<br/> Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish;<br/> And she said, "It's a fact the whole world knows,<br/> That Pobbles are happier without their toes."<br/> <a class="pagenumber" id="page363" name="page363" title="363"/> </p>

					<h4>THE NEW VESTMENTS</h4>
					<p><span class="largecap">T</span>here lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,<br/> Who invented a purely original dress;<br/> And when it was perfectly made and complete,<br/> He opened the door and walked into the street.</p>
					<p>By way of a hat he'd a loaf of Brown Bread,<br/> In the middle of which he inserted his head;<br/> His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,<br/> The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;<br/> His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;<br/> His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;<br/> His Waistcoat and Trowsers were made of Pork Chops;<br/> His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;<br/> His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,<br/> And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;<br/> And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,<br/> A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.</p>
					<p>He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,<br/> Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;<br/> And from every long street and dark lane in the town<br/> Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.<br/> Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;<br/> Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;<br/> <a class="pagenumber" id="page364" name="page364" title="364"/> Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,<br/> And the tails were devour'd by an ancient He Goat;<br/> An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore <i>up</i> his<br/> Pork Waistcoat and Trowsers to give to their Puppies;<br/> And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,<br/> Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.<br/> He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,<br/> For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:<br/> They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;<br/> They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;<br/> And now from the housetops with screechings descend<br/> Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:<br/> They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,<br/> When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;<br/> They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,<br/> And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;<br/> They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall,—<br/> Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.</p>
					<p>And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,<br/> "I will not wear a similar dress any more,<br/> Any more, any more, any more, never more!"</p>

Z!</span> <a class="pagenumber" id="page366" name="page366" title="366"/> <span class="i8">What put it into your head</span> <span class="i4">To climb up this wall, my own</span> <span class="i16">Darling Mr. Discobbolos?"</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
					<p>Mr. Discobbolos answered,<br/> <span class="i4">"At first it gave me pain,</span> <span class="i2">And I felt my ears turn perfectly pink</span> <span class="i2">When your exclamation made me think</span> <span class="i4">We might never get down again!</span> But now I believe it is wiser far<br/> To remain for ever just where we are."<br/> <span class="i8">And Mr. Discobbolos said,</span> <span class="i8">"Oh! W! X! Y! Z!</span> <span class="i8">It has just come into my head</span> <span class="i4">We shall never go down again,</span> <span class="i16">Dearest Mrs. Discobbolos!"</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
					<p>So Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos<br/> <span class="i4">Stood up and began to sing,—</span> <span class="i2">"Far away from hurry and strife</span> <span class="i2">Here we will pass the rest of life,</span> <span class="i4">Ding a dong, ding dong, ding!</span> We want no knives nor forks nor chairs,<br/> No tables nor carpets nor household cares;<br/> <span class="i8">From worry of life we've fled;</span> <span class="i8">Oh! W! X! Y! Z!</span> <span class="i8">There is no more trouble ahead,</span> <span class="i4">Sorrow or any such thing,</span> <span class="i16">For Mr. and Mrs. Discobbolos!"</span> </p>
					<h3>THE QUANGLE WANGLE'S HAT.</h3>
					<p class="versenumber">I.</p>
					<p><span class="largecap">O</span>n the top of the Crumpetty Tree<br/>
					<span class="i2">The Quangle Wangle sat,</span> But his face you could not see,<br/> <span class="i2">On account of his Beaver Hat.</span> For his Hat was a hundred and two feet wide,<br/> With ribbons and bibbons on every side,<br/> And bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,<br/> So that nobody ever could see the face<br/> <span class="i6">Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
					<p>The Quangle Wangle said<br/> <span class="i2">To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,</span> <a class="pagenumber" id="page368" name="page368" title="368"/> "Jam, and jelly, and bread<br/> <span class="i2">Are the best of food for me!</span> But the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree<br/> The plainer than ever it seems to me<br/> That very few people come this way<br/> And that life on the whole is far from gay!"<br/> <span class="i6">Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
					<p>But there came to the Crumpetty Tree<br/> <span class="i2">Mr. and Mrs. Canary;</span> And they said, "Did ever you see<br/> <span class="i2">Any spot so charmingly airy?</span> May we build a nest on your lovely Hat?<br/> Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!<br/> O please let us come and build a nest<br/> Of whatever material suits you best,<br/> <span class="i6">Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
					<p>And besides, to the Crumpetty Tree<br/> <span class="i2">Came the Stork, the Duck, and the Owl;</span> The Snail and the Bumble-Bee,<br/> <span class="i2">The Frog and the Fimble Fowl</span> (The Fimble Fowl, with a Corkscrew leg);<br/> And all of them said, "We humbly beg<br/> We may build our homes on your lovely Hat,—<br/> Mr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!<br/> <span class="i6">Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"</span> </p>
					<a class="pagenumber" id="page369" name="page369" title="369"/>
					<p class="versenumber">V.</p>
					<p>And the Golden Grouse came there,<br/> <span class="i2">And the Pobble who has no toes,</span> And the small Olympian bear,<br/> <span class="i2">And the Dong with a luminous nose.</span> And the Blue Baboon who played the flute,<br/> And the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute,<br/> And the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,—<br/> All came and built on the lovely Hat<br/> <span class="i6">Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">VI.</p>
					<p>And the Quangle Wangle said<br/> <span class="i2">To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,</span> "When all these creatures move<br/> <span class="i2">What a wonderful noise there'll be!"</span> And at night by the light of the Mulberry moon<br/> They danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon,<br/> On the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree,<br/> And all were as happy as happy could be,<br/> <span class="i6">With the Quangle Wangle Quee.</span> </p>
					<h3>THE CUMMERBUND. An Indian Poem.</h3>
					<p class="versenumber">I.</p>
					<p><span class="largecap">S</span>he sate upon her Dobie, <span class="i2">To watch the Evening Star,</span> And all the Punkahs, as they passed, <span class="i2">Cried, "My! how fair you are!"</span> Around her bower, with quivering leaves, <span class="i2">The tall Kamsamahs grew,</span> And Kitmutgars in wild festoons <span class="i2">Hung down from Tchokis blue.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">II.</p>
					<p>Below her home the river rolled <span class="i2">With soft meloobious sound,</span> Where golden-finned Chuprassies swam, <span class="i2">In myriads circling round.</span> Above, on tallest trees remote <span class="i2">Green Ayahs perched alone,</span> And all night long the Mussak moan'd <span class="i2">Its melancholy tone.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">III.</p>
					<p>And where the purple Nullahs threw <span class="i2">Their branches far and wide,</span> </p>
					<p><a class="pagenumber" id="page371" name="page371" title="371"/> And silvery Goreewallahs flew <span class="i2">In silence, side by side,</span> The little Bheesties' twittering cry <span class="i2">Rose on the flagrant air,</span> And oft the angry Jampan howled <span class="i2">Deep in his hateful lair.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">IV.</p>
					<p>She sate upon her Dobie, <span class="i2">She heard the Nimmak hum,</span> When all at once a cry arose, <span class="i2">"The Cummerbund is come!"</span> In vain she fled: with open jaws <span class="i2">The angry monster followed,</span> And so (before assistance came) <span class="i2">That Lady Fair was swollowed.</span> </p>
					<p class="versenumber">V.</p>
					<p>They sought in vain for even a bone <span class="i2">Respectfully to bury;</span> They said, "Hers was a dreadful fate!" <span class="i2">(And Echo answered, "Very.")</span> They nailed her Dobie to the wall, <span class="i2">Where last her form was seen,</span> And underneath they wrote these words, <span class="i2">In yellow, blue, and green:</span> </p>
					<p>"Beware, ye Fair! Ye Fair, beware! <span class="i2">Nor sit out late at night,</span> Lest horrid Cummerbunds should come, <span class="i2">And swollow you outright."</span> </p>
