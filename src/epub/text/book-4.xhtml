					<h4 epub:type="title">The Dong with a Luminous Nose</h4>
					<p>
						<span>When awful darkness and silence reign</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the great Gromboolian plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Through the long, long wintry nights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the angry breakers roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As they beat on the rocky shore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore⁠—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then, through the vast and gloomy dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There moves what seems a fiery spark⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">A lonely spark with silvery rays</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Piercing the coal-black night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">A Meteor strange and bright:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Hither and thither the vision strays,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">A single lurid light.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever as onward it gleaming goes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those who watch at that midnight hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry, as the wild light passes along⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">“The Dong! the Dong!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">The Dong! the Dong!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i4">Long years ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong was happy and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Who came to those shores one day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And the rocks are smooth and gray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the woods and the valleys rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i6">
							<em>“Far and few, far and few,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i6">
							<em>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i6">
							<em>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i6">
							<em>And they went to sea in a sieve.”</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Happily, happily passed those days!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i8">While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">They danced in circlets all night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i8">In moonlight, shine, or shade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For day and night he was always there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till the morning came of that hateful day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the Dong was left on the cruel shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazing, gazing for evermore⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ever keeping his weary eyes on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pea-green sail on the far horizon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Singing the Jumbly Chorus still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he sat all day on the grassy hill⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i10">
							<em>“Far and few, far and few,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i10">
							<em>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i10">
							<em>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i10">
							<em>And they went to sea in a sieve.”</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when the sun was low in the West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">The Dong arose and said⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>—“What little sense I once possessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Has quite gone out of my head!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And since that day he wanders still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By lake and forest, marsh and hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Singing, “O somewhere, in valley or plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ever I’ll seek by lake and shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And because by night he could not see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">On the flowery plain that grows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">And he wove him a wondrous Nose⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of vast proportions and painted red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tied with cords to the back of his head.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">—In a hollow rounded space it ended</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">All fenced about</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">With a bandage stout</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">To prevent the wind from blowing it out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And with holes all round to send the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now each night, and all night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over those plains still roams the Dong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lonely and wild, all night he goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all who watch at the midnight hour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moving along through the dreary night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">“This is the hour when forth he goes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Yonder, over the plain he goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">He goes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">He goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong with a luminous Nose!”</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">The Two Old Bachelors</h4>
					<p>
						<span>Two old Bachelors were living in one house;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One caught a Muffin, the other caught a Mouse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said he who caught the Muffin to him who caught the Mouse⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“This happens just in time! For we’ve nothing in the house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save a tiny slice of lemon and a teaspoonful of honey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what to do for dinner⁠—since we haven’t any money?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what can we expect if we haven’t any dinner,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin’!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But how to get that Stuffin’ it is difficult to tell!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But someone said, “A hill there is, a little to the north,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Climb up, and seize him by the toes⁠—all studious as he sits⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps)⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When your Stuffin’ will be ready, and very good⁠—perhaps.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those two old Bachelors without loss of time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“You earnest Sage!” aloud they cried, “your book you’ve read enough in!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin’!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At those two Bachelors’ bald heads a certain aim he took;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin’),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Mouse had fled⁠—and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">The Pelican Chorus</h4>
					<p>
						<span>King and Queen of the Pelicans we;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No other Birds so grand we see!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None but we have feet like fins!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lovely leathery throats and chins!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican Jill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By night we sleep on the cliffs above;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By day we fish, and at eve we stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On long bare islands of yellow sand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the sun sinks slowly down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where the purple river rolls fast and dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wing to wing we dance around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this is the song we nightly snort⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Last year came out our Daughter Dell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the Birds received her well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do her honor a feast we made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every bird that can swim or wade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They ate and drank and danced all night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And echoing back from the rocks you heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yes, they came; and among the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With pea-green trousers all so neat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a delicate frill to hide his feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For though no one speaks of it, every one knows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He has got no webs between his toes).</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In violent love that Crane King fell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On seeing her waddling form so fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And before the end of the next long day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our Dell had given her heart away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the King of the Cranes had won that heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a Crocodile’s egg and a large fish-tart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And away they flew in a gathering crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And far away in the twilight sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We heard them singing a lessening cry⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farther and farther, till out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we stood alone in the silent night!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Often since, in the nights of June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We sit on the sand and watch the moon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we probably never shall meet again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft, in the long still nights of June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We sit on the rocks and watch the moon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we probably never shall see her more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Plumpskin, Ploshkin, Pelican jill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>

						<span>There lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who invented a purely original dress;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when it was perfectly made and complete,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He opened the door and walked into the street.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>By way of a hat he’d a loaf of Brown Bread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the middle of which he inserted his head;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Waistcoat and Trousers were made of Pork Chops;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from every long street and dark lane in the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the tails were devour’d by an ancient He Goat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore <em>up</em> his</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now from the housetops with screechings descend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,</span>
